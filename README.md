Introducing #Adulting: The Ultimate Home Maintenance App

Welcome to #Adulting, the app designed to help you maintain and care for your new home like a pro. As a responsible homeowner, it's crucial to stay on top of maintenance tasks, and that's where #Adulting comes in. Our app provides built-in templates for essential maintenance tasks that you may not even be aware of, ensuring your home is properly upheld. By diligently performing these tasks, you can save significant amounts of money in the long run.

Why #Adulting? Because we recognized a gap in the market that standard reminder apps fail to address. We developed this app to cater specifically to individuals who have made a significant purchase and want to ensure they maintain it effectively. Our goal is to simplify the process and empower homeowners like you to take control of their maintenance responsibilities.

One of the key features of #Adulting is the auto-population of due dates for tasks based on the specific time intervals required for each project. Let's say you recently changed your windshield wipers and logged it into the app. Our intelligent system will automatically calculate and set up the next due date for you to change them again, precisely six months from the initial replacement. This streamlined functionality ensures you never miss a crucial maintenance task.

During the development of #Adulting, we leveraged cutting-edge technologies to enhance user experience and functionality. We utilized handlebars to efficiently template out web pages, providing a seamless and intuitive interface for our users. Additionally, we integrated SendGrid, a powerful email delivery platform, to send automated reminders directly to your inbox. Our integration with node schedule ensures that these reminders are sent at the precise time they are needed.

At #Adulting, we're committed to making home maintenance as effortless as possible. Our app takes the guesswork out of upkeep by providing comprehensive templates, automatic due date calculations, and convenient email reminders. With #Adulting by your side, you can confidently maintain your new home, saving both time and money in the process.
